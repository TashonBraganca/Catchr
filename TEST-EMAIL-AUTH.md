## 🔥 LATEST FIX - LOADING SCREEN FREEZE

**Problem**: After signing in, refreshing the page (F5) caused the app to freeze on "Loading Cathcr..." screen forever.

**Root Cause**: Profile fetch was blocking the loading state. The app waited for the database query to complete before showing the HomePage.

**Fix Applied** (Commit 8d6f0a2):
- Changed profile fetch from **blocking** to **background/non-blocking**
- Loading state now sets to `false` immediately after session check
- Profile loads in background without blocking UI
- User sees HomePage instantly, profile populates when ready

**Deployed**: 5 minutes ago to https://cathcr.vercel.app
