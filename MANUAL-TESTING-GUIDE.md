## 🧪 Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Manual Note Creation

1. **Open production URL** in Chrome (use Incognito for clean state)

2. **Sign in** with your account (Google/GitHub/Email)

3. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)

4. **Click "+ New" button** (top right)

5. **Type a test note**:
   ```
   This is a test note to verify text visibility and database save functionality
   ```

6. **Verify text is visible**:
   - Text should be dark gray/black, NOT white
   - You should be able to read what you type

7. **Click "Create Note"**

8. **Watch console logs** - You should see:
   ```
   📝 [AppShell] Manual note creation: { contentLength: XX }
   💾 [AppShell] Creating manual note...
   🔍 [useNotes] Starting database insert...
   🔍 [useNotes] Insert result: { data: {...}, error: null }
   ✅ [useNotes] Insert successful, creating note object...
   ✅ [useNotes] Note object created: <note-id>
   ✅ [useNotes] Note added to state, returning: <note-id>
   ✅ [AppShell] Manual note created successfully: <note-id>
   ```

9. **Check if note appears in list** (left sidebar)

10. **Copy ALL console logs** and send them

### Test 2: Empty Note Validation

1. **Click "+ New"** again

2. **Don't type anything**

3. **Click "Create Note"**

4. **Should see alert**: "Please enter some content for your note"

5. **Console should show**: `⚠️ [AppShell] Empty content, not creating note`

### Test 3: Voice Note Creation

1. **Click the microphone/voice button** (if available)

2. **Allow microphone access**

3. **Speak clearly** for 2-3 seconds

4. **Stop recording**

5. **Watch console logs** - Look for:
   ```
   🎤 [Whisper] Starting voice transcription...
   ✅ [Whisper] Transcription completed: { text: "...", length: XX }
   🤖 [GPT-5] Categorizing thought...
   🎯 [AppShell] Voice note completion: { transcript: "...", ... }
   💾 [AppShell] Creating note from voice transcript...
   🔍 [useNotes] Starting database insert...
   ```

6. **Copy ALL console logs**

## 📊 What to Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators

- Text is dark and visible in textarea ✅
- No alert errors ✅
- Console shows "✅ Insert successful" ✅
- Console shows "✅ Note object created" ✅
- Console shows "✅ Note added to state" ✅
- Note appears in left sidebar list ✅

### ❌ Failure Indicators

## 📋 Summary

We have deployed comprehensive debug logging that will tell us **exactly where** note creation is failing:

- ✅ If it fails at database insert → RLS policy issue
- ✅ If it fails at data return → Column mismatch issue
- ✅ If it fails at state update → Frontend state issue
- ✅ If it succeeds but doesn't show → UI rendering issue

**The console logs will give us the answer!** 🎯
