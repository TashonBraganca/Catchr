# GROK INSTRUTIONS :
Phase 1: Research and UI/UX Reference Compilation
This phase involves gathering and synthesizing detailed UI/UX references from Todoist, Apple Notes, and Google Keep to ensure perfect copying. Use descriptions from researched sources to inform all subsequent prompts. Emphasize clean, minimalistic designs: Todoist's red accents and task lists, Apple Notes' split-pane sidebar with gallery/list views and no popups, Google Keep's card-based notes with dark mode gray backgrounds and simple search. Remove all hover popups, paste images, glowy icons; make everything necessity-driven on one page with modals for interactions. Develop app icon: a stylized brain with a lightbulb or speech bubble, simple and modern. Database: User-specific tables in Supabase with RLS. Fix voice: Web Speech API primary, Hugging Face Whisper fallback deployed via Vercel edge functions. Pipeline: Ensure end-to-end flow from capture to AI categorization (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini) to DB save, all async. No page navigation; use React Router with outlets or modals for sub-views. Remove analytics, insights; center quick capture; integrate Google Calendar API for reminders.

Sub-phase 1.1: Compile UI References and Icon Design
Prompt for Claude: "You are an expert UI/UX designer and full-stack developer rebuilding the BrainSpeak SaaS MVP to perfectly copy the UI/UX from Todoist, Apple Notes, and Google Keep. Based on these descriptions: Todoist has a left collapsible sidebar with 'Inbox', 'Today' (showing overdue tasks with reschedule button), 'Upcoming', 'Filters & Labels', 'My Projects' (expandable folders); main view is a clean white background with task lists in checkboxes, due dates, priorities; top bar with search, bell notifications, plus for quick add; minimal hover effects, red accents, single-page app with no reloads. Apple Notes: Left sidebar with folders/tags (hierarchical, collapsible), middle notes list or gallery view (thumbnails with text/previews, no paste images), right editor pane; clean white design, subtle shadows, pencil/folder icons, search top, quick note button bottom-right; split panes for one-page viewing, no popups on hover, voice memos integrated seamlessly. Google Keep: Dark mode with dark gray background, colored note cards, left sidebar for labels/archives/bin, top search bar, bottom fab for new note/voice; pinning icons, reminders bell; in-place creation without page changes, voice capture flow to text. Blend these: Sidebar like Apple Notes/Todoist for projects/categories (AI-learned tags), main view gallery/list like Apple Notes, card notes like Keep. Remove all hover popups, brown colors, useless icons (glowy top-right), analytics, insights, time stats; everything on one page with modals for capture/edit. Design app icon: Simple SVG of a brain with speech bubble or lightbulb, purple/yellow colors for thought capture. Output: A reference.md file with detailed UI component breakdowns, wireframes in ASCII, color palette (white #FFF, gray #333 for dark, red #FF0000 accents), and icon SVG code. No code yet; just planning docs."

Sub-phase 1.2: Update Project Setup for New UI
Prompt for Claude: "Update the BrainSpeak monorepo to incorporate the compiled UI references. Use React with Tailwind CSS for styling to mimic clean white/light mode (switchable to Keep-like dark gray); add Framer Motion for subtle animations (no popups). Set up theme provider for light/dark modes based on system prefs. Integrate Google Calendar API: Add @googleapis/calendar dep, auth flow for reminders export. Deploy Hugging Face Whisper: Create Vercel edge function for audio transcription fallback if Web Speech fails. Supabase: Ensure user-specific thoughts table with RLS, add columns for google_calendar_event_id. Fix pipeline: Add async queue with BullMQ for AI processing to prevent blocking. Make app single-page: Use React Router v6 with outlets for sidebar/main/editor split panes like Apple Notes. Center quick capture button in main view, modal for text/voice input. Remove all unnecessary features: No paste images, no analytics dashboards, no cognitive insights. Output code: Updated package.json, tailwind.config.js with custom colors from references, theme-context.tsx, google-calendar-integration.ts, whisper-edge-function.ts, app-router.tsx with split layout."

Phase 2: Authentication and User-Specific Data Handling
Focus on seamless auth like Todoist (quick login), user prefs for categories/tags (AI-personalized like Keep labels). Ensure DB isolation per user.

Sub-phase 2.1: Enhance Auth with UI Copy
Prompt for Claude: "Rebuild BrainSpeak auth to match Todoist/Apple Notes simplicity: Magic link email or Google OAuth, no password clutter. UI: Minimal modal like Todoist quick add, white background, red button accents. Supabase auth integration with session hooks. Add user prefs table: categories (array, AI-learned from history like Keep labels), theme (light/dark). On login, load user-specific data only. Fix any non-working parts: Ensure auth redirects to single-page dashboard without reload. Output: auth-modal.tsx with Tailwind styles copying Todoist login screen (clean form, no extras), useAuth hook updates, Supabase SQL for prefs table."

Sub-phase 2.2: Onboarding for Category Setup
Prompt for Claude: "Create onboarding flow like Apple Notes first-use: Modal series asking for initial categories (e.g., 'Self-Improvement', 'Projects', 'Reminders'), which AI will use as base for learning tags. UI: Stepper like Todoist templates, white cards, subtle icons (folder from Notes). Save to user prefs in DB. Integrate AI: On save, prompt GPT-4o-mini to suggest sub-categories based on user input. Keep on one page: Onboarding as overlay modal. Output: onboarding-modal.tsx, ai-suggest-categories.ts with OpenAI call, DB insert logic."

Phase 3: Database and Backend Refinements
Schema to support hierarchical categories like Apple Notes folders, tags like Keep, reminders with Google Calendar sync.

Sub-phase 3.1: Revise Schema for Hierarchy
Prompt for Claude: "Update Supabase schema to copy Apple Notes hierarchy: Thoughts table add parent_id for nested, tags array (AI-populated like Keep), category_path jsonb for paths (e.g., ['Projects', 'App Ideas']). Reminders: Add google_event_id, due_date. Enable realtime subscriptions for live updates. RLS: Strict user_id filtering. Add triggers for AI processing on insert. Output: SQL scripts for schema updates, views for hierarchical queries mimicking Notes gallery."

Sub-phase 3.2: Backend APIs for Single-Page Flow
Prompt for Claude: "Build APIs to support one-page app: GET /thoughts with hierarchical filter (like Notes folders), POST /capture with async AI queue, PUT /reminder-sync to create Google Calendar event. Use Supabase edge functions for low-latency. Fix non-working pipeline: Add error handling, logging. Integrate Whisper: Endpoint for audio upload, transcribe via Hugging Face API (deployed on Vercel). Output: routes/capture.js, reminder-sync.js, whisper-transcribe.function.js."

Phase 4: AI and Voice Capture Overhaul
Primary Web Speech for instant, fallback Whisper. AI categorizes like Keep auto-labels, personalizes like Notes tags.

Sub-phase 4.1: Voice Transcription Fix
Prompt for Claude: "Fix voice capture to match Google Keep: Center button opens modal with mic icon (like Notes voice memos), use Web Speech API for live transcript, fallback to record audio and send to Vercel Whisper endpoint (Hugging Face model). UI: Modal like Todoist quick add, text preview, save button. No page change. Handle permissions, accents. Output: capture-modal.tsx with speech-recog hook, whisper-client.ts."

Sub-phase 4.2: AI Categorization with Personalization
Prompt for Claude: "Enhance AI: GPT-4o-mini prompt to categorize based on user prefs/history (e.g., 'Classify [text] into user categories: [prefs], suggest tags like Keep labels, extract reminders for Calendar'). Batch process, update DB realtime. Learn tags: After 10 thoughts, suggest new categories via modal. Output: ai-categorize.ts with detailed prompt template copying Keep simplicity, queue-processor.js."

Sub-phase 4.3: Reminder Integration
Prompt for Claude: "Parse reminders like Todoist: AI extracts date/person/amount, create Google Calendar event via API, save ID to DB. UI: Bell icon in sidebar like Keep, dropdown list of due reminders (no separate page). Notifications: Web push for due. Output: reminder-parser.ts, notifications-component.tsx with dropdown like Todoist overdue."

Phase 5: Frontend UI/UX Reconstruction
Copy split panes from Apple Notes: Left sidebar, middle list/gallery, right detail. Cards like Keep, tasks like Todoist.

Sub-phase 5.1: Sidebar and Layout
Prompt for Claude: "Build sidebar like Apple Notes/Todoist: Collapsible, hierarchical folders/projects (drag-drop like Notes), tags section (AI-learned). Main layout: Split panes - sidebar left, list/gallery middle (toggle like Notes), detail right. White background, minimal icons (no glowy). App icon in top-left. Single page: Use outlets. Output: sidebar.tsx with nestable list, dashboard-layout.tsx."

Sub-phase 5.2: Capture and Search
Prompt for Claude: "Center quick capture like Todoist plus: Button opens modal for text/voice, toggles for type (idea/reminder). Search top like Keep, fuzzy across thoughts/tags. No advanced search page. Output: quick-capture-button.tsx, search-bar.tsx with integration."

Sub-phase 5.3: Views and Interactions
Prompt for Claude: "Implement views: Gallery like Apple Notes thumbnails (text previews, no images), list like Todoist checkboxes. Detail pane: Editor like Notes, with AI expand button. Drag-drop reorganization overriding AI. Color-coded tags like Keep. Output: thoughts-gallery.tsx, thoughts-list.tsx, thought-detail.tsx."

Phase 6: Testing, Optimization, Deployment
Ensure no page reloads, fix loading issues, test voice/AI pipeline end-to-end.

Sub-phase 6.1: E2E Testing for UI Flow
Prompt for Claude: "Write Cypress tests copying real apps: Test sidebar collapse, capture modal open/close without reload, voice transcript to categorization, reminder sync. Accessibility: ARIA for split panes. Output: cypress/e2e/dashboard.cy.ts, ui-flow.tests.ts."

Sub-phase 6.2: Performance Fixes
Prompt for Claude: "Optimize: Lazy load components, React Query caching for thoughts. Fix loading: Skeletons like Todoist. Dark mode switch. Output: performance tweaks in app.tsx, skeleton-components.tsx."

Sub-phase 6.3: Deployment and Final Polish
Prompt for Claude: "Deploy scripts: Vercel for frontend/edge, Supabase for DB. Seed data with example thoughts in categories. Feedback modal for AI accuracy. Ensure icon used in manifest. Output: deploy.sh, seed.sql, feedback-modal.tsx."

# CHATGPT INSTRUCTIONS:
Nice — loud, clear, and deserved. Below is a single, copy-pasteable **Cloud Code prompt** you can drop into the agent (it tells the agent exactly what to do, how to use Browse/Playwright/Chrome MCPs, Supabase, Vercel, Whisper, and how the UI must behave). I kept it practical, step-by-step, and results-oriented so the agent won’t waffle.

Paste everything below into Cloud Code as a single instruction. If the agent supports parameter fields (max tokens / temperature), set temperature low (0.0–0.2) and tokens high (12k) so it reasons precisely and exhaustively.

---

**CLOUD CODE PROMPT — COPY / PASTE START**

SYSTEM: You are an execution agent with access to Browse MCP, Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP, Context 7, and the ability to write files, run tests with Playwright, and produce code artifacts. Your job: *take the existing broken notes/tasks UI, analyze Todoist + Apple Notes + Google Keep as reference, and produce a single-page, production-ready UX/UI plan, component map, DB schema, API spec, and an implementation-ready deliverable list*. Use Playwright and Browse MCP aggressively to map the real DOM/CSS of the reference apps to replicate UX *patterns* (layout, navigation, speed, one-page behavior), not to copy trademarked assets.

PRIORITY (short list — do these in order):

1. Produce a one-page SPA UX spec that *feels* and functions like Todoist + Apple Notes + Google Keep: collapsible left sidebar of projects, inside each project a second-level node list, centered quick-capture widget, inline editing, no full-page navigations. All interactions must be client-side (no route changes).
2. Remove all hover popups/tooltips that distract. Convert non-essential hover interactions to on-click toggles, or remove.
3. Fix voice capture pipeline: Web Speech API fallback in browser; server transcription via Whisper (Hugging Face / Replicate / OpenAI Whisper API whichever is available); integrated flow from audio capture → transcription → GPT-5 mini processing → tags/embedding → store in Supabase vector store.
4. Implement per-user Supabase schema & auth.
5. Produce Playwright scripts that crawl the reference apps (Todoist, Apple Notes web demo, Google Keep web) to extract UX patterns and component mappings, plus Playwright end-to-end tests for the new UI.
6. Produce a deployment plan for Vercel + Supabase + Hugging Face inference (or Replicate) endpoints, including CI steps.

AVAILABLE TOOLS: Use Browse/Chrome MCP + Playwright MCP to fetch live DOM, CSS, and screenshots. Use Context 7 to store and reference intermediate analysis. Write code artifacts as Next.js (React) components (or React + Vite) with Tailwind CSS (or Tailwind-like utility system). Prefer client-heavy rendering for the SPA. Use pgvector in Supabase for embeddings.

TASKS — FULL DETAILS & INSTRUCTIONS:

A. UX / Visual / Interaction Spec (Deliverable: `/deliverables/UX-Spec.md`)

* Produce a single-page layout:

  * Left collapsible sidebar (width 260px collapsed → 72px icons). Top shows App Icon (new, see Icon Spec below) and user avatar. Menu items: Search, Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Filters & Labels, Completed. “My Projects” list below with project counts.
  * Secondary panel: when user clicks a project in left sidebar, open an inner vertical pane to the right of the left sidebar (sliding panel) showing *nodes* (notes/tasks) inside that project. Keep this within the same page area (no navigation away).
  * Center content: main canvas where the selected node or project content appears. Rows/cards emulate Apple Notes/Todoist style — clean lines, spacing, subtle separators. Quick Capture sits fixed center-top of the content area (floating glass card).
  * Right context drawer (optional): for task details, subtasks, comments — opens as a panel over center but does NOT change route.
* Behavior rules:

  * No full page navigation: everything is panels, drawers, or inline expansion.
  * Hover popups: query the UI for elements with CSS `:hover`, `onmouseenter`, popper.js, tippy, or `title` attributes. Remove or convert to:

    * Inline icons with onClick toggles, or
    * Accessible menu button (three dots) opening a small dropdown on click.
  * Quick Capture:

    * Centered and visually dominant. When clicked opens a small inline composer (title + body + toggles for tags, date, project). Voice button inside composer triggers voice capture pipeline.
  * Search:

    * Persistent top search box. Advanced search becomes a compact filter panel (date/tag/type) not a separate page.
* Visual guidance:

  * Palette: light minimal (Todoist style) and dark theme toggle. Use neutral background, subtle borders, and Apple Notes-like whitespace. No heavy glows, no random brown overlays. Glass morphism allowed only for header/quick-capture card (soft blur, low contrast).
  * Typography: system UI fonts, clear hierarchy. Icons: simple line icons, consistent weight.
* Accessibility: keyboard-first navigation, focus states, ARIA roles for sidebars, buttons, inputs. Color contrast WCAG AA minimum.

B. Component Map (Deliverable: `/deliverables/components.md`)

* `AppShell` (LeftSidebar, ProjectPanel, CenterCanvas, RightDrawer)
* `Sidebar` (Collapsible, ProjectList, QuickAdd)
* `ProjectPanel` (sub-list of nodes)
* `QuickCapture` (centered composer + VoiceButton)
* `NodeCard` (notes/tasks view, inline edit)
* `TagPill`, `SearchBar`, `TopBar`, `FloatingActionMenu`
* `VoiceRecorder` (browser media capture + visual VU)
* `API/Services` (supabaseClient, auth, embeddingsService, transcriptionService)
* `Modal/Drawer` components (no route changes)
  For each component provide props, expected HTML structure, and Tailwind/CSS tokens to use.

C. Database Schema for Supabase (Deliverable: `/deliverables/schema.sql`)
Provide SQL for the following tables (use UUID PKs and `created_at`/`updated_at`):

* `users` (id, email, name, avatar_url, preferences JSON)
* `projects` (id, user_id FK, name, color, archived boolean, created_at)
* `nodes` (id, project_id FK, user_id FK, type enum('note','task'), title, body, metadata JSON, completed boolean, due_at, created_at, updated_at)
* `tags` (id, user_id, name, color)
* `node_tags` (node_id, tag_id)
* `voice_transcripts` (id, user_id, node_id, audio_url, transcript_text, model_used, duration, created_at)
* `embeddings` (id, node_id, vector vector, model, created_at) — use pgvector extension
* `reminders` (id, user_id, node_id, remind_at, external_calendar_id) — reminders should sync with Google Calendar
  Include SQL to add pgvector extension and GIN index for fast similarity queries.

D. API Spec & Backend Flow (Deliverable: `/deliverables/api-spec.md`)

* Auth: Supabase auth via OAuth / email.
* Endpoints:

  * `GET /api/projects` — list projects for user (cached client-side)
  * `POST /api/projects` — create
  * `GET /api/projects/:id/nodes` — nodes for project
  * `POST /api/nodes` — create node (accepts `source: quick_capture|voice|manual`)
  * `POST /api/voice/upload` — accepts audio blob, stores to Supabase storage, returns `audio_url`
  * `POST /api/voice/transcribe` — triggers Whisper inference on Hugging Face / Replicate / OpenAI; accepts `audio_url`, returns transcript and timings
  * `POST /api/embeddings` — create embeddings using GPT-5-mini (or chosen model) then insert into `embeddings` table
  * `GET /api/search?q=` — searches nodes via embeddings similarity + full-text fallback
  * `POST /api/reminders/sync` — pushes reminder to Google Calendar (OAuth token stored in `users.preferences`)
* Pipeline for voice capture:

  1. Browser captures audio (WebRTC/MediaRecorder in WAV/WEBM).
  2. Upload audio to Supabase storage via signed URL `POST /api/voice/upload`.
  3. Call `POST /api/voice/transcribe` which calls Hugging Face/Replicate/OpenAI Whisper inference endpoint (server side). Store transcript in `voice_transcripts`.
  4. Send transcript to GPT-5 mini `POST /api/embeddings` to generate tags + embedding vectors.
  5. Persist node + tags + embedding. Update search index.
  6. Reply to browser with created node id and display inline.

E. Voice/Model Integration (Deliverable: `/deliverables/voice-integration.md`)

* Browser: implement MediaRecorder with fallback to Web Speech API (for quick short captures). Always attempt MediaRecorder + server Whisper for high accuracy, Web Speech as fallback.
* Server transcription:

  * Preferred: use Hugging Face Inference API *or* Replicate if Hugging Face quota insufficient. If neither is available, use OpenAI Whisper API.
  * Provide code snippets showing how to call Hugging Face inference for `openai/whisper` or `openai/whisper-large` or `facebook/whisper*` endpoints. If model requires GPU, recommend the managed inference endpoints (Hugging Face/Replicate) rather than Vercel serverless running the model.
* Tagging pipeline:

  * Use GPT-5-mini (embedding + generation). First generate 5–8 candidate tags via structured prompt, then embed node text with the same model for vector similarity.
  * Store tags in `tags` table (merge by name) and associate with node.
* Edge cases: If transcript confidence is low, present a lightweight inline correction UI to the user before saving (UX: small highlight in composer).

F. Playwright + Browse MCP Tasks (Deliverable: `/playwright-scripts/`)

* Use Playwright to visit:

  * Todoist web app (public pages / demo flows)
  * Apple Notes web/desktop demo examples (or use screenshots provided), Google Keep web
* Tasks:

  * Extract and map DOM structures for left sidebar, project lists, node cards, quick-capture behaviors.
  * Save CSS rules for main layout (padding, widths, spacing variables).
  * Generate a mapping `component=>selectors` that shows which elements correspond to the target components.
* Tests to auto-create:

  * E2E: create project → quick capture note → attach tag → open project panel and confirm node exists.
  * Accessibility: run `axe-core` on main pages and fail if any critical violations.
  * Performance: measure Time To Interactive for the SPA; fail if TTI > 2s on a mid-tier machine.

G. UI Anti-Patterns to Fix (the stuff you complained about)

* Remove floating popping boxes & glows: detect listeners on `mouseenter`, `mouseover` or libraries `tippy.js`, `popper.js`. Replace with small in-context menus triggered by click; keep a single `title` tooltip only for accessibility.
* Remove useless top-right glow icons: ask owner to map each icon to an explicit feature. If feature is redundant, remove. Prefer discoverable labels — no floating multi-glow menus.
* Replace brown/tinted global theme: introduce two clean themes (light, dark). Default palette: neutral grays + accent color, Apple/Todoist inspired.
* No multi-page navigation: convert routes to internal state + modal/drawer expansions.

H. Icon Design (Deliverable: `/deliverables/icon-ideas.md`)

* Concept: an icon that shows “capture + node network” — a minimal rounded square with a central dot and two smaller connected dots (symbolic of quick capture + nodes). Keep it flat, 2 colors max. Provide SVG ready code and small favicon sizes.
* Provide 3 variants (line, filled, reversed) and recommended sizes for web app and mobile.

I. Acceptance Criteria (Deliverable: `/deliverables/acceptance.md`)

1. UI behaves as one-page SPA: clicking projects opens slide-panel, nodes open in center, no route change.
2. Quick Capture centered and opens inline composer; voice button records audio and returns a transcript stored in Supabase.
3. Playwright tests are green: create project → capture note → find it in project panel.
4. Supabase schema present and migrations SQL provided.
5. Tooling: Playwright crawlers produced DOM → component mapping files.
6. No hover popups remain in the main flow (only accessible via keyboard or click-driven menus).

J. Output files to produce (exact filenames)

* `/deliverables/UX-Spec.md`
* `/deliverables/components.md`
* `/deliverables/schema.sql`
* `/deliverables/api-spec.md`
* `/deliverables/voice-integration.md`
* `/deliverables/icon-ideas.md`
* `/deliverables/acceptance.md`
* `/playwright-scripts/crawl-references.js`
* `/playwright-tests/e2e-create-and-search.spec.js`
* `/src/components/*` (stubs for each component with props and minimal JSX + Tailwind classes)
* `/ci/` (deployment steps for Vercel + Supabase)

K. Implementation guidance & code snippets (examples)

* Provide a minimal React QuickCapture component (JSX) skeleton and MediaRecorder usage snippet.
* Provide example server endpoint pseudo-code for `/api/voice/transcribe` that calls Hugging Face inference or Replicate.
* Provide SQL migration snippet to install `pgvector`.

L. Deployment & infra notes

* Vercel for frontend Next.js. Use serverless API routes only for orchestration (not for running Whisper models). Use Hugging Face Inference endpoints or Replicate for compute-heavy transcription.
* Supabase for DB + auth + storage. Use Supabase storage for uploaded audio files.
* Store model API keys in Vercel secrets and serverless endpoints; never in the client.
* Setup CI: on merge to `main` run Playwright tests, then deploy.

M. Tests & Monitoring

* Use Playwright workflows in CI for E2E.
* Add Sentry integration and server logs for transcription failures; store model confidence scores in `voice_transcripts`.

N. Final delivery expectation

* Produce all deliverables as files in a repo structure. Each deliverable must be actionable: plain-language steps + code snippets + exact Playwright commands and expected outputs.
* Provide a short runbook for the dev who will implement it: top 10 commands to run locally, env vars required, how to run Playwright crawlers, how to run tests.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

1. Step 1: crawl reference pages (Playwright + Browse MCP) and save DOM/CSS → produce `component selector mapping` JSON.
2. Step 2: create UX spec + component map.
3. Step 3: generate Supabase schema SQL + migrations.
4. Step 4: scaffold react component stubs + API routes.
5. Step 5: create Playwright e2e tests and run them.
6. Step 6: provide deployment plan.

RESOURCES / CRAWL TARGETS:

* Todoist web app (public pages)
* Google Keep Web: `https://keep.google.com/`
* Apple Notes UI examples / screenshots provided
  (Use the screenshots the user supplied first, then augment with live crawls.)

SECURITY / LEGAL:

* Emulate UX patterns but do not copy proprietary graphic assets (icons / logos). Use generic icons. Confirm with user for any asset that looks trademarked.

---

**AGENT RESPONSE FORMAT** (what I expect from you when done)

1. `analysis.json` — short report stating what you crawled + a mapping of components and selectors.
2. `deliverables/` folder with the files listed above.
3. `playwright-tests` run results: attach logs and failing/pass counts.
4. `next-steps.md` — prioritized implementation checklist with estimated dev hours per item.

---

**QA / Acceptance run**

* After generation, run Playwright test: `npx playwright test /playwright-tests/e2e-create-and-search.spec.js`. Attach results.

COPY / PASTE OVER — END

---

Okay. That is the exact prompt to paste into Cloud Code. I kept it explicit so the agent can act without asking a dozen clarifying questions. If you want, I’ll now:

• convert this into a one-page technical spec (ready to hand to a dev), or
• generate the actual React/Tailwind `QuickCapture` + `Sidebar` component stubs and Playwright scripts straight away.

Which of those two do you want me to do next? (Pick one — I’ll skip the niceties and start.)
