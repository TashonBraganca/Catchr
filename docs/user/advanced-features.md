# Advanced Features

Master Cathcr's powerful features to become a thought capture expert. This guide covers advanced functionality that helps you organize, search, and manage your thoughts like a pro.

## Advanced Search

### Search Operators

#### Boolean Logic
```
# AND operator (both terms must exist)
work AND meeting

# OR operator (either term can exist)
project OR task

# NOT operator (exclude terms)
meeting NOT cancelled

# Grouping with parentheses
(work OR project) AND urgent
```

#### Field-Specific Search
```
# Search in specific fields
title:"weekly standup"
category:work
content:"AI integration"
created:2024-01-15
```

#### Wildcard and Fuzzy Search
```
# Wildcard matching
meet*          # matches meeting, meetings, meets
*ing           # matches anything ending in 'ing'

# Fuzzy search (typo tolerance)
meetng~        # matches meeting (1 character diff)
prject~2       # matches project (2 character diff)
```

#### Date Range Search
```
# Specific dates
created:2024-01-15
modified:>2024-01-01
created:[2024-01-01 TO 2024-01-31]
