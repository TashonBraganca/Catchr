# CLAUDE DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - MUST FOLLOW

**THINK HARD, wait for my instructions. COMPLETE REVAMP AND REDOING OF THE WEBSITE. CREATE A NEW .MD FILE CALLED REVAMP.MD AND I WILL PASTE CONTENT AND ADVICE FROM CHATGPT AND GROK AND I NEED YOU TO IMPLEMENT EACH ONE OF THEM. AND THIS TIME I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW MY INSTRUCTIONS WELL AND HARD. DO NOT MISS ANYTHING MAKE SURE TO ONLY FOLLOW WHAT IS PASTED IN THERE. WHAT YOU HAVE DONE IS NOT FOLLOWED MY IDEAS AND I HATE IT.**

### Key Points:
- **WAIT** for user instructions before implementing anything
- **FOLLOW EXACTLY** what the user specifies in REVAMP.md
- **DO NOT** make assumptions about what the user wants
- **IMPLEMENT ONLY** what is explicitly requested
- **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** if anything is unclear

*This instruction must be followed strictly on all future development work.*
