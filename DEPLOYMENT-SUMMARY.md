## Breaking Changes

### 1. Database Migration Required ⚠️

**CRITICAL**: Migration 004 must be applied BEFORE deploying frontend code.

**Why**: Frontend code expects `title` and `is_pinned` columns to exist.

**How**:
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `supabase/migrations/004_user_settings_calendar.sql`
3. Verify success
4. THEN deploy frontend

**What Happens If Skipped**:
- Notes won't save
- Console errors: "column does not exist"
- App becomes unusable

### 2. Extension Authentication Flow ⚠️

**Changed**: Extension now requires new authentication flow.

**Why**: Improved security and connection management.

**Impact**: Existing extension users need to reconnect.

### 3. GPT-5 Nano API Usage ⚠️

**Changed**: Using Responses API instead of Chat Completions API.

**Why**: GPT-5 models only work with Responses API.

**Impact**: None for users, backend implementation detail.

## Deployment Risks

### High Risk Items
1. **Database Migration**: If not applied, app breaks
   - Mitigation: Clear instructions, verification steps
   - Rollback: SQL commands provided

2. **Voice-to-Note Flow**: Complex integration with multiple APIs
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, detailed logging
   - Rollback: Git revert, previous version promotion

### Medium Risk Items
3. **Extension Authentication**: New flow may have edge cases
   - Mitigation: Manual testing completed
   - Rollback: Previous extension version available

4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Performance on large datasets
   - Mitigation: Tested with 1000+ notes
   - Rollback: Simple code revert

### Low Risk Items
5. **Documentation Updates**: No code impact
6. **Test Files**: Not deployed to production
7. **UI Animations**: Progressive enhancement

---

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (Git)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```
**Time**: <2 minutes
**Impact**: Reverts all changes

### Selective Rollback (Vercel Dashboard)
1. Go to deployments
2. Promote previous deployment
**Time**: <1 minute
**Impact**: Instant rollback

### Database Rollback (If Needed)
```sql
ALTER TABLE thoughts DROP COLUMN title;
ALTER TABLE thoughts DROP COLUMN is_pinned;
```
**Time**: <1 minute
**Impact**: Removes new columns
